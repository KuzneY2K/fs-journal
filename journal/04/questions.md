# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Asynchronous code runs in the background. Synchronous code is executed in block. Asynchronous code will not pause the file from being parsed when its ran.

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener waits for something specific to happen so that it can execute code attached to it.

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > RESTful application. It exposes information about it self in the form of information about its resources. It stands for representational state transfer.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > A callback is a javascript usage convention. Instead of instantly executing something instantly it does it asynchronously. You can also pass arguements through the callback.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > A promise will get resolved eventually. When the method is executed, other code can be ran in the background while this one finishes up. You capture an arror with a catch statement.

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > GET, POST, PUT

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application Program Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > You must declare an asynchronous function.

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > Encapsulation helps with writing cleaner code. It also keeps other code that doesnt need to be seen, hidden. The state is kept hidden and only methods of objects can access it.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > Bad request. The server will not process the request it receives due to an error on the client's side
