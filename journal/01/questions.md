# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > In my own words I believe Git is used as a version storage for projects as well as a back up.
    Multiple Devs can be working on a project in parallel and if something major gets messed up
    everyone can fall back on an older version without losing the entire project.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > "make directory" It is used to create a new folder/directory.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > The pseudo class targets a certain state of the element like :hover or targets a specific element like :nth-child(2) or :first-child.
    I think Ill be using the pseudo class to target specific elements and their child.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Determines which rule will be applied in case there are multiple like rules.
    I'd use it to my benefit if I needed to emphasize something. If I had an element with a global class but
    needed it SLIGHTLY modified to emphasize it, I would assign it a specific id(#) on top of the class. Now I could
    use inline styling too but I don't really like doing that.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Overlapping !important and broken code.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, Propery and Value within the declaration block.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > I think good design will influence higher site conversion. I know for a fact that good looking websites generate more revenue over
    mediocre looking websites. I wouldn't want to buy a product or service from a business if their website has poor design and doesn't look
    professional. If a business can't invest or put effort into their website, then how else will I know that they invest and put effort into what they are wanting to sell to me?

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | ANSWER HERE |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > The flex property makes a website layout more flexible than standard plain old CSS.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > width, height, padding, margin, border, scale
